# Portfolio Website

## Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio website! This site serves as a showcase of my work, skills, and experiences as a software engineer. It is built using the Chirpy theme, a beautiful and modern Jekyll theme, and hosted on GitHub Pages. I wanted to create a space where I could display my projects, share my thoughts, and connect with others in the industry.

## Technologies Used

- **Jekyll**: A static site generator that transforms plain text into static websites. Jekyll makes it easy to create and manage content, and is perfect for building simple, fast, and secure websites.
- **Chirpy** Theme: A stylish and feature-rich Jekyll theme that provides a clean and elegant design. Chirpy offers a responsive layout, easy customization, and a host of features such as dark mode, syntax highlighting, and SEO optimization.
- **GitHub Pages**: A hosting service offered by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. It provides a simple and free way to get your website online and accessible to the world.

## Features

- **Project Showcase**: A dedicated section to display my past and current projects, including descriptions, images, and links to live demos or code repositories.
- **Blog**: A platform for me to share my thoughts, tutorials, and industry insights. I plan to regularly update this section with new content, providing valuable resources for fellow developers.
- **About Me**: A personal introduction, highlighting my skills, experiences, and passions. This section gives visitors a glimpse into my background and what drives me as a software engineer.
- **Contact**: An easy way for visitors to get in touch with me. I've included links to my social media profiles and provided a contact form for direct messages.
