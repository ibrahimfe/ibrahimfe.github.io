# About Me

Welcome to my portfolio! I’m Ibrahim, a passionate and dedicated third-year college student based in Indonesia. I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science, and my journey has been fueled by a deep interest in cyber security, Linux, and Python programming. My goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge to work remotely in the USA while enjoying the vibrant culture and beauty of Indonesia.

## My Journey

From a young age, technology has always fascinated me. This curiosity led me to explore various facets of computer science, ultimately shaping my career path. As an IT Support Intern, I am gaining hands-on experience in troubleshooting and resolving technical issues, which enhances my problem-solving abilities and broadens my understanding of IT infrastructure.

## Skills and Interests

In my academic and professional journey, I have honed my skills in several key areas:

1. Cyber Security: I am dedicated to understanding the nuances of securing digital environments, protecting data, and mitigating potential threats.
2. Linux: I have a profound appreciation for the power and flexibility of Linux systems, which I regularly use and explore.
3. Python Programming: My proficiency in Python allows me to develop efficient and scalable solutions for various challenges.

## Goals and Aspirations

My ultimate goal is to work remotely as a SOC Analyst in the USA while living in Indonesia. This unique setup would allow me to combine the best of both worlds: contributing to innovative projects globally while enjoying the local lifestyle and staying connected to my roots.

## Personal Interests

When I’m not immersed in the digital world, I love exploring new technologies, participating in coding challenges and Capture the Flag, and contributing to open-source projects. These activities not only keep me engaged but also provide continuous learning opportunities, helping me stay ahead in this ever-evolving field.
